# MTR Light Rail 705 for OpenBVE
This is an attempt at re-creating the MTR Light Rail 705 route for the train simulator [OpenBVE](https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE).  
Last tested OpenBVE version is v1.9.0.0.  

**This project is Work In Progress, and development is stagnet, see below.**

## Development
The current developed section only includes **Tin Tsz, Tin Wu and Ginza station**, and primary development has fully stalled in ~November 2022.

The original goal is to make a phase 1 release for the section from **Tin Tsz -> Wetland Park**.  
However due to the shear amount of work and an (arguably) outdated development method, this project will likely remain dormant. And even with active development, it will be a multi-year journey to get the whole or even half the route done.

Nevertheless it is released to the public for potential new people to look into the development of OpenBVE, the behind the scenes, and also I just think it's a bit of a waste having spent too much time on something that will never see the light of day.

Contributing is always welcomed, whether big or small. And perhaps one day enough progress can be made to fulfill the original goal.
