----- Performance - Textures -----
1. Texture resolution should be in Power of Two (e.g. 256x128, 512x512, 768x256).
Otherwise there will be a chance that the texture will be scaled up internally, causing high VRAM usage and white texture

2. Do not use any transparency effect within the PNG unless absolutely necessary as this also causes more VRAM usage. (Use color key transparency color instead)
It is recommended to save images without transparency effect to 24bit color to ensure that transparent pixels aren't used.

3. Use an texture atlas, aka putting two or more images together, then use texture coordinate to map the corresponding part. This decreases lag spikes in general.

4. Do not create another duplicated texture just to darken the texture, use SetColor with a texture loaded instead.
