The reason why it's named rotat_ed is because OpenBVE intercepts single-line csv file.
"rotated" is an CSV command (It's the same thing as the rotate command), and therefore got intercepted by the object parser.
This would cut the command text off, resulting in a white texture.
This has been fixed in the latest OpenBVE version, but for backward compatibility reason is named "rotat_ed".
